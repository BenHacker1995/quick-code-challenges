# Mini Code Challenges
The purpose of this repo is to provide practice with the HTML/CSS portion of front-end/full-stack code challenges. What we will do is to look at elements of modern websites isolated from the whole layout/page (like buttons or cards), to think about code challenges from a visual and usability perspective, as well as to provide a fun challenge to solve. 


## Time Limits
Each section has a time limit, try to honor those times.

## Code Challenge Rules
### Prepare/Plan - 5 minutes
Planning for a code challenge is extremely important. This helps set you up for success. 
1. Open the folder for the challenge you would like to attempt.
    * [Button Challenge](/button-challenge/README.md)
    * [Card Challenge](/card-challenge/README.md)
2. View the provided challenge readme and assets.
3. Write down any questions you might have. (Very important!)

## Coding time! 
### 10 minutes
Use an online code editor site like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen/) to quickly get started without having to setup folders/files. 

## Reflection
### No time limit
This is a time to ask yourself some questions about the process. 
- How did it go? 
- Did anything surprise or stump you? 
- Anything you wish you knew before you got started? 
- What assumptions did you make? 

# Conclusion
When completing a code challenge during the interview process, planning will go a long way. 

_Always_ spend time preparing before coding. Make an action plan, even if it is a simple list of todo's.

_Always_ prepare a list of questions to send back to the hiring manager regarding the code challenge. You do not have to wait to get a response to those questions, because they might not answer them anyway. This demonstrates that you are considering unknowns and assumptions about the designs you were provided.  

*An example email response to code challenge:*

_I am really excited to get started coding the challenge you provided me! I have some questions that I would like clarification on, if possible._

_You indicated that you would like this challenge coding responsively, is there a minimum size viewport you would like me to code to? 400px, 320px, etc?_

_The provided images files did not show a hover, an active, or a focus state on the buttons or links. Is there a preference to how those should be handled?_

In addition to planning, attention to detail is very important in these challenges. Consider the following: 
- Did you represent the design accurately? 
- Do the line heights, font properties, and colors match exactly to the design? 
- Did you consider accessilibity in your designs? 
- Did you make any assumptions? If so, communicate those back to the hiring manager when you send in your final code challenge.

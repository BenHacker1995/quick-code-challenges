# Mini Code Challenges
The purpose of this repo is to provide practice with the HTML/CSS portion of front-end/full-stack code challenges. What we will do is to look at elements of modern websites isolated from the whole layout/page (like buttons or cards), to think about code challenges from a usability and accessibility perspective, and provide a fun challenge to solve. 


## Time Limits
Each section has a time limit, so try to honor those times. The idea is to get you thinking about the process of practicing a code challenge, not to make an absolute perfect representation in the short time given.

## Code Challenge Rules
### Prepare/Plan - Spend 5 minutes here
Planning for a code challenge is extremely important. This helps set you up for success. 
1. Open the folder for the challenge you would like to attempt.
    * [Button Challenge](/button-challenge/README.md)
2. View the provided challenge readme and assets.
3. Write down any questions you might have. (Very important!)

## Coding time! 
### Spend 10 minutes here
Use an online code editor site like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen/) to quickly get started without having to setup folders/files. 

## Reflection
### No time limit
This is a time to ask yourself some questions about the process. 
- How did it go? 
- Did anything surprise or stump you? 
- Anything you wish you knew before you got started? 


# Conclusion
When completing a code challenge for a company, the process of planning will go a long way. _Always_ some time preparing before coding. Make an action plan, even if it is simple. _Always_ prepare a list of questions to send back to the hiring manager regarding the code challenge. You do not have to wait to get a response to those questions, because they might not answer them anyway, but to show that you are thinking about all aspects of the code challenge provided shows that you care about the quality of code you provide. 

An example email response to code challenge:
```
I am really excited to get started coding the challenge you provided me! I have some questions that I would like clarification on, if possible. 

I noticed that you mentioned you would like this challenge coding responsively, is there a minimum size viewport you would like me to code to? 400px, 320px, etc? 

The provided images files did not show a hover, an active, or a focus state on the buttons or links. Is there a preference to how those should be handled?
